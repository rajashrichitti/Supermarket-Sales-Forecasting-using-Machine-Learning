# Supermarket-Sales-Forecasting-using-Machine-Learning
Accurate sales forecasting and sentiment-based review categorization using machine learning and deep learning techniques in the retail industry.

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning models for sales forecasting in the retail industry.

The goal is to evaluate the advantages of these models over traditional statistical methods by conducting a thorough investigation and examination of predictive models.

Additionally, the project addresses the challenge of categorizing reviews based on sentiment analysis to aid product makers in decision-making processes. The implemented approach involves techniques such as Linear Regression, Random Forest model, K-neighbors Regressor, XGBoost Model, and a custom deep learning neural network. The models are evaluated using real-world sales data from Walmart stores. The project aims to provide accurate sales projections and valuable insights for effective decision-making. A detailed report documenting the methodology, findings, and analysis is available for reference.
